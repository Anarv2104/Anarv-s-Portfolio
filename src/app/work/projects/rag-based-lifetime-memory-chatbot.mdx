## Overview

RAG-Based Lifetime Memory Chatbot is an advanced conversational AI system that combines Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) with persistent memory capabilities, enabling the chatbot to maintain context and knowledge across multiple sessions and conversations.

## Key Features

- **Retrieval-Augmented Generation**: Implements RAG architecture for accurate and contextual responses based on external knowledge sources.
- **Persistent Memory System**: Maintains conversation history and learned information across multiple sessions for personalized interactions.
- **Lifetime Learning**: Continuously learns from interactions to improve response quality and contextual understanding.
- **Knowledge Retention**: Stores and retrieves relevant information from past conversations for enhanced user experience.
- **Contextual Responses**: Provides intelligent responses based on both current input and historical conversation context.

## Technologies Used

- **AI Framework**: LangChain for RAG implementation and memory management
- **Vector Database**: For efficient storage and retrieval of conversation embeddings
- **Language Model**: Integration with advanced language models for natural conversation
- **Memory Architecture**: Custom persistent memory system for long-term knowledge retention
- **Backend**: Python-based backend for chatbot logic and data processing
